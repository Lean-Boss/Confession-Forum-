# Confession-Forum-
imagine yourself in a room, alone. you take a piece of paper and you start writing your deepest fears, your wildest fantasies, your craziest memories. no one to judge, no one physically there to criticize, just you and your confessions.. this is what the website is all about. a place to simply let it out.
